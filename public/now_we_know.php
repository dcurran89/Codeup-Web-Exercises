//  NOW WE KNOW CLASSES

// construction function - magic method, runs automatically when you make an object of a class
// variables are now public
// $this 
// create objects based on class
// arrows instead of hash rockets or dots
// deconstruct
// functions are called methods
// class names are capitals
// file and class share a name
// classes are blueprints

//OBJECTS bundle/are state and behavior
//PUBLIC means that in our procedural code we can access that property

//*********************************************************
// I THINK I'VE GOT IT

// magic method - functions that run automatically
// file that calls all the functions/file that runs everything
// $this - only inside of classes, not in procedural code
// public? what else if interaction between the two files, class and procedural code
// when an object closes/ends
// will globals be replaced by this
// are constructors necessary
// using methods on their own
// what order to put things in (on class)
